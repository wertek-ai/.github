# Wertek AI

Industrial Asset Intelligence Infrastructure.

We build a dynamic Operational Risk Engine that combines:

- ISO 14224 criticality modeling
- Multi-source condition monitoring
- Manual + sensor health integration
- Graph-based asset relationships
- AI-assisted diagnostics
- Risk-based capital allocation

---

## The Problem

Industrial plants collect massive amounts of data.
Very few translate it into decision clarity.

---

## Our Approach

Impact (Criticality)
×
Condition (Health Index)
=
Operational Risk

We help engineers decide:

- Where to monitor
- Where to inspect
- Where to invest
- Where to act

---

## Current Deployment

Enterprise pilot in a 900 MW combined-cycle power plant.
